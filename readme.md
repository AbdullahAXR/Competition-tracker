- [ ] Managers

    - Competition Manager
        - [ ] fix bug where you cant write two competitions that share the same
          name. Right now, I made it so that the manager will ignore a
          duplicate competition (a competition with the same name as another
          competition).

    - Competition builder
        - [ ] I don't think the code is very readable. Tell me your opinion.

        - [ ] find a better way to store the style. The current way is too dirty. Suggestions:
                - Pass the cell style object to the competition builder
                - 

    - Competition parser 100% complete
