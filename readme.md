# TODOs

- [x] Entities: 100% complete

- [ ] Managers: pretty much complete... just some minor issues

    - [ ] fix bug where you cant write two competitions that share the same
      name. Right now, I made it so that the manager will ignore a
      duplicate competition (a competition with the same name as another
      competition).

    - [ ] Perhaps that competition builder should read the style from a
      file called cellStyle.dat instead of trying to replicate
      whatever it finds on the ID cell. It's also probably more
      efficient way to do it that way


- [ ] Viewers: pretty much 0% complete... Just a quick status bar is completed
