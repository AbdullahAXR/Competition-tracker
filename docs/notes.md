# How excel files are structured

- Workbook: The actual file

- Sheet: Specific pages in the excel file (this actually corresponds to the competition name)

- Row: A row is obvious

- Cell: A cell is obvious

Notice that a `Cell` is contained within a `Row`, which is contained within
`Sheet`, which is contained within a `WorkBook`.

There's a Test.java file that has some examples. Feel free to add more examples
so others can see. Just add your example as a method or something.
